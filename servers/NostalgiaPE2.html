        <h1>NostalgiaPE 2</h1>
        <pre>NostalgiaPE2 was created in 2022/08/24 because Tema1d didn't want to continue working on original NostalgiaPE. 
NostalgiaPE2 was the first NostalgiaPE without whitelist. Instead, Tema1d created a special plugin that allowed players to join and walk on the server without having to be verifed in discord. 
The server still required verification through discord to allow placing or destroying blocks and to write to chat. 
The original NostalgiaPE continued working until NPE2 closed. 
This server closed at the same time as NostalgiaPE. 3 days after the server closed, zanz, one of the moderators on this server decided to reopen the server on free hosting FalixNodes.</pre>

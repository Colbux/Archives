        <h1>NostalgiaPE 3</h1>
        <pre>NostalgiaPE3 was created in 2023/01/08 to test PHP8 and NostalgiaCore 1.0.2dev. 
The server was launched in beta state. 
During the first 4 days the server was hosted on FreeHij's vds and had port 6666. Then, in 2023/01/12 the server moved to Tema1d's vds where it was kept until it was closed. 
The port also changed to 19132. 
3 days later, in 2023/01/15 the server got out of beta state and got officially released. 
The server closed in 2023/11/05.</pre>

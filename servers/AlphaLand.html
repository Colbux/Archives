        <pre>
AlphaLand - a group of servers that were created by Tema1d during late March 2021 - 2022.
The servers had at least 2 different discord servers (3 if Alphastalgia discord is counted), one of which was removed.
Due to removal of the first discord server, it is hard to tell the exact when was it created.
"Probably" Before the creation of the AlphaLand, Tema1d shared the idea to create a MCPE 0.14 server in
QBMC discord server on March 23rd, 2021 6:15PM (MSK). Later, on the same server at April 1st/2nd 2021, Tema1d
sent an invite link to the first AlphaLand discord. The link was later removed on April 2nd, 2021 at 12:01 AM (MSK) by the owner of QBMC.

Some time later, a new discord server was created. At the time of the creation AlphaLand was running on the 0.10.x.
0.10 server was closed on June 22nd, 2021 at 6:26 PM (MSK). Later, all the members(except Tema1d and iNavaja) were kicked.
Later, on 08th June 2022, the server was revived as event server for 3 days.
